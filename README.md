Welcome to the Helsinki City Bike application! This app was built using React, PostgreSQL, Express, and Node.js.

In this app, you can view data on all the journeys made and all the stations in Helsinki and Espoo. You can filter, search, and sort the stations to find the information you need. Each station page also includes additional details such as the address.

The next feature I am working on is a map that shows the location of each station. Stay tuned for updates!

Thank you for using the Helsinki City Bike application. I hope you find it useful.
